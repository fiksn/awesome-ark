A curated list of ARK resources

## What is it

ARK (previously known as TBDXXX placeholder) is a new bitcoin layer2 protocol proposed by [Burak Ke√ßeli](https://twitter.com/brqgoo).

The non-interactive version requires covenants (which can be achieved using [CTV](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki) or [APO](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0118.mediawiki)).

However using n-of-n multisig you can have a simplified version requiring all participants to be online. Which means ARK can be rolled out on bitcoin immediately.

It is complementary to lightning in a sense that you can still use lightning with ARK but most transactions will be done
directly off-chain (and off-channel). ARK service providers (ASPs) providing liquidity are usually also lightning service providers (LSPs).
